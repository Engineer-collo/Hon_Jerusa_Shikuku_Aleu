,I joined Engineer Antony Kibunguchi Cec Agriculture, Chief officer Cooperatives, Timothy Wanjala , Sub-Counties officers across Bungoma County and members from different cooperative societies at Lukhokhwe Comprehensive School in celebrating International  Day of Cooperatives.
It was a  great honor and pleasure to join  cooperators in  marking this important occasion  the International Day of Cooperatives, a day that celebrates the invaluable role that cooperative societies play in building resilient, inclusive, and sustainable communities.
With Driving Inclusive and Sustainable Solutions for a Better World as the theme,the theme speaks for itself directly to the heart of what cooperatives are and what they do. Cooperatives are not just economic entities,  they are instruments of social justice, economic empowerment, and collective progress in any given society.
Across our county, and indeed the entire country, cooperative societies have been the lifeline for millions with over 400 cooperatives society across Bungoma County, this cooperative acts as  bridges to opportunity,from SACCOs empowering our youth and women with financial services, to agricultural cooperatives giving small-scale farmers a voice in markets.
This financial year, my administration through the county government of Bungoma has allocated 2Million shillings for the renovation of NADAFA. I also urged engineer Kibunguchi to work on how grabbed government land will be repossessed  so  as to pave way for construction of more cooperative societies.
As your elected representative, I reaffirm my full support for the cooperative movement and as the county government, we are working to strengthen the legal and institutional frameworks to protect and empower cooperatives while facilitating access to affordable credit, training, and markets for our farm produce and also ensure that cooperatives are part of our broader development strategy, especially in rural areas.
